          <p id = 'blog32p'>
          Marathon Digital Holdings, a US publicly traded company, operates large-scale Bitcoin mining facilities. <br /> <br />
          Riot Blockchain, another US-based company, focuses on Bitcoin mining with environmentally friendly practices. <br /> <br />
          Some individuals have built successful mining operations, as seen in stories of early Bitcoin miners turning home rigs into significant holdings shared on online forums.</p>

          <h1 id = 'blog3h3'>Investing as a Retail Investor:
Here's how you can get involved:</h1>
          <p id = 'blog33p'>Direct Mining: Purchase mining rigs, which are expensive and require technical knowledge. <br /> <br />
          Mining Pools: Contribute your hashrate (processing power) for a share of the pool's rewards. Lower barrier to entry but lower rewards. <br /> <br />
          Cloud Mining: Least technical option, but comes with upfront costs and potential scams.</p>

          <h1 id = 'blog3h4'>Benefits, Risks and What to expect</h1>
          <p id = 'blog34p'>Earn crypto rewards, contribute to the blockchain, and potentially profit from rising cryptocurrency prices. <br /> <br />
          High upfront costs, volatile crypto market, fluctuating mining difficulty, and environmental concerns. <br /> <br />
          Don't expect instant riches. Profitability depends on factors like electricity costs, chosen coin, and market conditions. Embrace a long-term investment approach and be prepared for volatility.
